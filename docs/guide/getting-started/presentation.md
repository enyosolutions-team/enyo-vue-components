Vue Awesome Components is a set of useful components geared torwards the creation of quick back office pages. It
features widgets and components to make your life easier.

## History

This repository started with the team at Enyo building backoffices that were quite similar. I realised that we were
spending too much time to implement features that should have been easy and repetitive (think display a list of data
from the api in a table, and interact with it).

We found a few awesome libraries that were great a doing their part, but not necessarly at working together. Also we
realised that there was a need for a lot of configuration (parameters) for each page.

Hence we decided to cover improve our workflow with various ready to use components.
